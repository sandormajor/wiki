Retrieving user&amp;rsquo;s history # Using the CSS :visited selector, itâ€™s possible to apply a different style for URLs that have been visited.
Previously it was possible to use getComputedStyle() to detect this difference, but now browsers prevent this by always returning values as if the link was visited and limiting what styles can be applied using the selector.</description></item><item><title>CSS Injection</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/css-injection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/css-injection/</guid><description>CSS Injection # warning
This group of XS-Leaks requires a CSS injection on the target page. Among the different CSS injection vectors, the most noticeable one is the abuse of CSS Selectors. They can be used as an expression to match and select certain HTML elements. For example, the selector input[value^=&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;] is matched if the value of an input tag starts with the character &amp;ldquo;a&amp;rdquo;. So, to detect if a CSS Selector matches the expression, attackers can trigger a callback to one of their websites using certain properties like background, @import, etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
