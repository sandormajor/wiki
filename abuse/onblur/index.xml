Unfortunately, cross-origin websites can determine whether a given id is set anywhere on a page by leveraging the focus event and URL fragments. If https://example.com/foo#bar is loaded, the browser attempts to scroll to the element with id=&amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;. This can be detected cross-origin by loading https://example.com/foo#bar in an iframe; if there is an element with id=&amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;, the focus event fires. The blur event can also be used for the same purpose 1.</description></item><item><title>Scroll to Text Fragment</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/experiments/scroll-to-text-fragment/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/experiments/scroll-to-text-fragment/</guid><description>Scroll to Text Fragment (STTF) is a new web platform feature that allows users to create a link to any part of a web page text. The fragment #:~:text= carries a text snippet that is highlighted and brought into the viewport by the browser. This feature can introduce a new XS-Leak if attackers are able to detect when this behavior occurs. This issue is very similar to the Scroll to CSS Selector XS-Leak.</description></item></channel></rss>
