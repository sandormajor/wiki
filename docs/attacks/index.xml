This type of attack abuses Query-Based Search Systems to leak user information from an attacker origin 1 2. The original attack uses timing measurements to detect whether or not a search system returns results and works as follows:
Establish a baseline of the time needed for a request to return results (hit), and a baseline for the time needed by a request with no results (miss).</description></item><item><title>Window References</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/window-references/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/window-references/</guid><description>If a page sets its opener property to null or is using COOP protection depending on the users&amp;rsquo; state, it becomes possible to infer cross-site information about that state. For example, attackers can detect whether a user is logged in by opening an endpoint in an iframe (or a new window) which only authenticated users have access to, simply by checking its window reference. Run demo
Code Snippet # The below snippet demonstrates how to detect whether the opener property was set to null, or whether the COOP header is present with a value other than unsafe-none.</description></item><item><title>CSS Tricks</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/css-tricks/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/css-tricks/</guid><description>CSS Tricks # CSS can be used to trick a user into exposing information such as embedded pixel values by making visual changes that are affected by the embed.
Retrieving user&amp;rsquo;s history # Using the CSS :visited selector, itâ€™s possible to apply a different style for URLs that have been visited.
Previously it was possible to use getComputedStyle() to detect this difference, but now browsers prevent this by always returning values as if the link was visited and limiting what styles can be applied using the selector.</description></item><item><title>Error Events</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/error-events/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/error-events/</guid><description>When a webpage issues a request to a server (e.g. fetch, HTML tags), the server receives and processes this request. When received, the server decides whether the request should succeed (e.g. 200) or fail (e.g. 404) based on the provided context. When a response has an error status, an error event is fired by the browser for the page to handle. These errors also cover situations where the parser fails, for example when trying to embed HTML content as an image.</description></item><item><title>Frame Counting</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/frame-counting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/frame-counting/</guid><description>Window references allow cross-origin pages to get access to some of the attributes of other pages. These references become available when using or allowing iframe and window.open. The references provide (limited) information about the window as they still respect the same-origin policy.
One of the accessible attributes is window.length which provides the number of frames in the window. This attribute can provide valuable information about a page to an attacker.</description></item><item><title>Navigations</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/navigations/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/navigations/</guid><description>Detecting if a cross-site page triggered a navigation (or didn&amp;rsquo;t) can be useful to an attacker. For example, a website may trigger a navigation in a certain endpoint depending on the status of the user.
To detect if any kind of navigation occurred, an attacker can:
Use an iframe and count the number of times the onload event is triggered. Check the value of history.length, which is accessible through any window reference.</description></item><item><title>Cache Probing</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/cache-probing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/cache-probing/</guid><description>The principle of Cache Probing consists of detecting whether a resource was cached by the browser. The concept has been known since the beginning of the web 1 and initially relied on detecting timing differences.
When a user visits a website, some resources such as images, scripts, and HTML content are fetched and later cached by the browser (under certain conditions). This optimization makes future navigations faster as the browser serves those resources from disk instead of requesting them again.</description></item><item><title>Element leaks</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/element-leaks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/element-leaks/</guid><description>Some HTML Elements might be used to leak a portion of data to a cross-origin page. For example, the below media resources can leak information about its size, duration, type.
HTMLMediaElement leaks the media duration and the buffered times. Run demo HTMLVideoElement leaks the videoHeight and videoWidth some browsers may also have webkitVideoDecodedByteCount, webkitAudioDecodedByteCount and webkitDecodedFrameCount getVideoPlaybackQuality() leaks the totalVideoFrames. HTMLImageElement leaks the height and width but if the image is invalid they will be 0 and image.</description></item><item><title>ID Attribute</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/id-attribute/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/id-attribute/</guid><description>The id attribute is widely used to identify HTML elements. Unfortunately, cross-origin websites can determine whether a given id is set anywhere on a page by leveraging the focus event and URL fragments. If https://example.com/foo#bar is loaded, the browser attempts to scroll to the element with id=&amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;. This can be detected cross-origin by loading https://example.com/foo#bar in an iframe; if there is an element with id=&amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;, the focus event fires. The blur event can also be used for the same purpose 1.</description></item><item><title>postMessage Broadcasts</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/postmessage-broadcasts/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/postmessage-broadcasts/</guid><description>Applications often use postMessage broadcasts to share information with other origins. Using postMessage can lead to two kinds of XS-Leaks:
Sharing sensitive messages with untrusted origins
The postMessage API supports a targetOrigin parameter that can be used to restrict which origins can receive the message. If the message contains any sensitive data, it is important to use this parameter. Leaking information based on varying content or on the presence of a broadcast</description></item><item><title>CSS Injection</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/css-injection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/css-injection/</guid><description>CSS Injection # warning
This group of XS-Leaks requires a CSS injection on the target page. Among the different CSS injection vectors, the most noticeable one is the abuse of CSS Selectors. They can be used as an expression to match and select certain HTML elements. For example, the selector input[value^=&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;] is matched if the value of an input tag starts with the character &amp;ldquo;a&amp;rdquo;. So, to detect if a CSS Selector matches the expression, attackers can trigger a callback to one of their websites using certain properties like background, @import, etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
