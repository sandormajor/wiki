Explicit clocks are used by developers to get direct timing measurements, mechanisms of this type are offered explicitly by the browser. In contrast, implicit clocks utilize particular web features to create unintended clocks that allow measuring the relative passage of time.
Explicit Clocks # performance.now API # The performance.now() API allows developers to get high-resolution timing measurements.

These attacks have had different levels of impact over time, gaining new attention when browsers started shipping high-precision timers like performance.now().
To obtain timing measurements, attackers must use a clock, either an implicit or an explicit one. These clocks are usually interchangeable for the purposes of XS-Leaks and only vary in accuracy and availability. For simplicity, this article assumes the use of the performance.</description></item><item><title>Performance API</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/performance-api/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/performance-api/</guid><description>Performance API # The Performance API provides access to performance-related information enhanced by the data from the Resource Timing API which provides the timings of network requests such as the duration but when there’s a Timing-Allow-Origin: * header sent by the server the transfer size and domain lookup time is also provided.
This data can be accessed by using performance.getEntries or performance.getEntriesByName It can also be used to get the execution time using the difference of performance.</description></item><item><title>Execution Timing</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/execution-timing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/execution-timing/</guid><description>Measuring the time of JavaScript execution in a browser can give attackers information on when certain events are triggered, and how long some operations take.
Timing the Event Loop # JavaScript&amp;rsquo;s concurrency model is based on a single-threaded event loop which means it can only run one task at a time. If, for example, some time-consuming task blocks the event loop, the user can perceive a freeze on a page as a result of the UI thread being starved.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Timing</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/hybrid-timing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/hybrid-timing/</guid><description>Hybrid Timing Attacks allow attackers to measure the sum of a group of factors that influence the final timing measurement. These factors include:
Network delays Document parsing Retrieval and processing of subresources Code execution Some of the factors differ in value depending on the application. This means that Network Timing might be more significant for pages with more backend processing, while Execution Timing can be more significant in applications processing and displaying data within the browser.</description></item><item><title>Connection Pool</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/connection-pool/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/connection-pool/</guid><description>Another way to measure the network timing of a request consists of abusing the socket pool of a browser 1. Browsers use sockets to communicate with servers. As the operating system and the hardware it runs on have limited resources, browsers have to impose a limit. Run demo (Chrome) Run demo (Firefox)
To exploit the existence of this limit, attackers can:
Check what the limit of the browser is, for example 256 global sockets for TCP and 6000 global sockets for UDP.</description></item></channel></rss>
