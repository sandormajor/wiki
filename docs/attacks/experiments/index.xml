The portal element is only available on Chromium-based browsers under a preference flag. The corresponding specification is still under active discussion.
Unfortunately, research of this new feature has discovered some critical issues, including new XS-Leaks 1.
ID Leaks # Portals can be abused as an alternative to the ID Attribute XS-Leak.</description></item><item><title>Scroll to Text Fragment</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/experiments/scroll-to-text-fragment/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/experiments/scroll-to-text-fragment/</guid><description>Scroll to Text Fragment (STTF) is a new web platform feature that allows users to create a link to any part of a web page text. The fragment #:~:text= carries a text snippet that is highlighted and brought into the viewport by the browser. This feature can introduce a new XS-Leak if attackers are able to detect when this behavior occurs. This issue is very similar to the Scroll to CSS Selector XS-Leak.</description></item></channel></rss>
